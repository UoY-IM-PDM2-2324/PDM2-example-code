# PDM2-PRIVATE-example-code
This repo should be used to store practical sample solution code before it's ready to be made available to students. Only teaching staff should be given access to this repo.

Add sample solutions that are not ready to be released to their own branch (e.g. week1-practical1). To release a solution set, merge the branch into main then delete the branch. Pull the changes in main into the forked repo (PDM2-example-code). The code should now be available to students.
